# 🥥 Automated Coconut Sorting System  

An **AI-powered Coconut Sorting System** that automates coconut grading in two stages:  

1. **CNN-based Crack Detection** → Identifies whether a coconut is **Cracked ❌** or **Healthy ✅**  
2. **Random Forest Classification** → For healthy coconuts, predicts **Low / Medium / High** maturity and weight classes

## 🚀 Features  
- ✅ Crack detection using **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)**  
- ✅ Weight & maturity classification using **Random Forest**  
- ✅ Extracts **size, shape, and texture** features for classification  
- ✅ Cracked coconuts are automatically rejected  
- ✅ Real-time ready with **OpenCV** integration
